# Nursing Homes in Texas

State inspectors from the Texas Health and Human Services Commission inspect each of the state's nursing homes receving money from Medicare. They also conduct investigations when complaints are filed and send their findings of their surveys to Medicare. But when it comes to fines issued against nursing homes posing a health and safety risk to vulnerable elderly citizens, the system starts to get questionable. 

The data was downloaded from the [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services](https://data.medicare.gov/data/nursing-home-compare), where they publish the information for each nursing home in terms of five-star ratings, inspections, and penalties.

Tools used: Python (pandas, regular expressions), matplotlib, Microsoft Excel, Adobe Illustrator, HTML, CSS.
