  <p>Texas nursing facilities were cited over 3,000 times more in 2018 compared to 2016, according to CMS data. </p>
  <p>But the data might not even be telling the whole story. Even though inspectors are supposed to conduct surprise visits, facilities know that there is a potential window of inspection after someone files a complaint. Even if facilities wouldn't know when a state official might be coming in, nursing homes are usually allotted a time period where they can correct their deficiency under state law, so this suggests that they may have enough time to step into compliance after posing a threat to a resident whose family filed a complaint.</p>
  <p>Facilities are given up to 45 days to fix any issues of non-compliance before administering penalties unless the deficiency is “immediate jeopardy” (J, K or L). Some graphic, unsanitary reports are sometimes not listed as “immediate jeopardy”, giving nursing homes some leniency to correct something without any repercussion.</p>
